## üì¢ Developer's Notes - **Revert back to masonry gallery, logo updates, small detail/bug fixes**

- I liked how the masonry gallery filled the page more versus a carousel
    - I did keep the dynamic images from the carousel and used it to populated images randomly onto the masonry gallery
- I changed the color of the logo to green
    - The logo was rotated and flipped to face left
- I noticed early on that the skewing was a few degrees off, and if your viewport is wide enough you could see the overlapping background colors
    - I lowered the skew by a quarter and it looks much better, for a slight change
- I tried animating the wheels on our logo with `@keyframes` & the `rotate()` function

- Added AOS library for scrolling effects 
- Changed font from Inter to Roboto
- Changed masonry gallery format to a glider.js carousel
    - Carousel will display all photos randomly once, before replaying

# üõ†Ô∏è JunkForce Patch 0 ‚Äî First customer as a freelance web dev
üìÖ **Release Date:** July 8th, 2025

## üì¢ Developer's Notes - **Initial commit, deploy to Netlify, seamless skew transitions & parallax**

- The text content on this webpage is what the customer emailed. This is the first iteration of many and the start of a freelancing web dev
- I changed the layout design to go from a 50/50 text/hero-img section to a full background hero image with parallax scrolling
- I took a try at seamless skew transitioning layouts. I like it and it's simple once you understand to skew the bottom with one color, and fill in the following section with the same color
- Contact Form is live and the business owner will receive user feedback
