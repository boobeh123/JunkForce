- My deadline for this project is coming up and I haven't done much since my initial commit
    - I forgot to mention this on the initial commmit, but I am using the ![Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework to style this website
- Added AOS library for scrolling effects 
- Changed font from Inter to Roboto
- Changed masonry gallery format to a glider.js carousel
    - Carousel will display all photos randomly once, before replaying
- Added comments to the stylesheets to organize my sections
    - Still need to clean up media queries & apply DRY principles

# üõ†Ô∏è JunkForce Patch 0 ‚Äî First customer as a freelance web dev
üìÖ **Release Date:** July 8th, 2025

## üì¢ Developer's Notes - **Initial commit, deploy to Netlify, seamless skew transitions & parallax**

- The text content on this webpage is what the customer emailed. This is the first iteration of many and the start of a freelancing web dev
- I changed the layout design to go from a 50/50 text/hero-img section to a full background hero image with parallax scrolling
- I took a try at seamless skew transitioning layouts. I like it and it's simple once you understand to skew the bottom with one color, and fill in the following section with the same color
- Contact Form is live and the business owner will receive user feedback
