## Version History

# 🛠️ JunkForce Patch 0.8 — Remove AOS library & fix horizontal scrolling
📅 **Release Date:** July 21th, 2025

---

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **The layout used way too many animations**

- AOS was nice at first, then it loses the novelty
- Horizontal scrolling existed on mobile & tablet
    - I commented out all my html, went section by section (header-hero-services-gallery-about-contact-footer) to determine what was causing horizontal scrolling
        - The implementation I used to design the skew layout caused it and there is a better approach

# 🛠️ JunkForce Patch 0.6 — Paid web dev
📅 **Release Date:** July 16th, 2025

---

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Update image, paragraphs, headers**

- I met with my client and learned that companies/business owners that own a website must be ADA compliant 
    - The American Disability Act ensures that individuals with disabilities in Hawaii have equal access to employment, public services, public accommodations, and transportation.
        - Websites are considered "places of public accommodation"
            - This means that businesses, including those that operate primarily or solely online, must ensure their websites are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
                - <b>WCAG is widely considered the standard for achieving accessibility under the ADA</b>

I build websites using the WCAG as a standard.

# 🛠️ JunkForce Patch 0.3 — Caught up
📅 **Release Date:** July 12th, 2025

---

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Semantic html, Form Input validation, Rename all images, privacy policy & terms of service page,**

- I am waiting for feedback from the customer and decided to leave this as my final-final draft
    - Updated Semantic HTML elements across all `.html` files
    - Updated ARIA labels/roles across all `.html` files
    - Added input validation to the contact form inputs
- Added a privacy policy & TOS page-- the only data collected is from our contact form
    - There is no backend & no database on this website, so no data/collected is being stored in that sense
- Cleaned up some comments so the code looks cleaner
- Fixed a bug with the hamburger menu
    - Clicking a link from the hamburger menu, didn't close the menu
- Made the font-color darker so it is more visible/legible
- I (manually) renamed most of the images as text that describes the photo
    - I am extracting the file name (description) and storing the description as the image's alt text
- Added a spinner to the submit button when submitting a form

# 🛠️ JunkForce Patch 0.2 — Catching up
📅 **Release Date:** July 11th & 12th, 2025

---

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Revert back to masonry gallery, logo updates, small detail/bug fixes**

- I liked how the masonry gallery filled the page more versus a carousel
    - Kept the dynamic images from the carousel and used it to populate images randomly onto the masonry gallery
- Changed the color of the logo to green
    - The logo was rotated and flipped to face left
- Noticed early on that the skewing was a few degrees off, and if your viewport is wide enough you could see the overlapping background colors
    - Lowered the skew by a quarter and it looks much better, for a slight change
- Tried animating the wheels on our logo with `@keyframes` & the `rotate()` function

- My deadline for this project is coming up and I haven't done much since my initial commit
    - I forgot to mention this on the initial commmit, but I am using the <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> framework to style this website
- Added AOS library for scrolling effects 
- Changed font from Inter to Roboto
- Changed masonry gallery format to a glider.js carousel
    - Carousel will display all photos randomly once, before replaying

# 🛠️ JunkForce Patch 0 — First customer as a freelance web dev
📅 **Release Date:** July 8th, 2025

---

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Initial commit, deploy to Netlify, seamless skew transitions & parallax**

- The text content on this webpage is what the customer emailed. This is the first iteration of many and the start of a freelancing web dev
- I changed the layout design to go from a 50/50 text/hero-img section to a full background hero image with parallax scrolling
- I took a try at seamless skew transitioning layouts. I like it and it's simple once you understand to skew the bottom with one color, and fill in the following section with the same color
- Contact Form is live and the business owner will receive user feedback
