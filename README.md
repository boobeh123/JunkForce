# 🛠️ JunkForce Patch 0 — First customer as a freelance web dev
📅 **Release Date:** July 8th, 2025

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Initial commit, deploy to Netlify, seamless skew transitions & parallax**

- The text content on this webpage is what the customer emailed. This is the first iteration of many and the start of a freelancing web dev
- I changed the layout design to go from a 50/50 text/hero-img section to a full background hero image with parallax scrolling
- I took a try at seamless skew transitioning layouts. I like it and it's simple once you understand to skew the bottom with one color, and fill in the following section with the same color
- Contact Form is live and the business owner will receive user feedback
